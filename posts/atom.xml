    <title>GSoC progress update: difficulties and change of plans</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of my proposed contributions have pull requests opened and are looking good (I believe). Many of them have at least some kind of feedback or review. However, we have discussed that one of my PRs that would include data without a proper paper backing it up does not align with pvlib python objectives. Therefore, I am looking both for papers and datasets that have some spectral response data of, preferably, common PV cell materials. Help is welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

I’m going to talk a bit about how I work on the programming projects I’m involved with, and how I plan to continue working on GSoC.

Google Summer of Code 2024 participation
========================================

This is the first post in a series of posts that will be published in the
coming weeks to talk about my participation in Google Summer of Code 2024.

I will be contributing to the project `*pvlib python* <https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ under the NUMFocus umbrella organization.

The focus of my project will be to improve existing capabilities, add more scientific models, models and utilities regarding spectral and shading analysis.

I will update this page with my proposals once they get published.

I'm very thankful to the pvlib team for giving me this opportunity, specially to Adam R. Jensen and Kevin Anderson for their guidance and support.

So, let's get started!

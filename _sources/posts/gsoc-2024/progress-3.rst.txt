GSoC progress update: last PRs of the project
=============================================

Thanks to all the reviewers and fellow GSoC students reviewing my PRs, I have been able to keep a good pace of contributions. What's more, I've been able to do a few things more outside of my project, specially regarding documentation, bugs, typos and tests.

From my original planning, the proposal of adding a few spectral responses wasn't merged since the data proposed was not guaranteed to represent each technology. And the PR about how to compute shadings on a 2D surface from a 3D scene is still open, waiting for feedback on whether it gives value to the project or not. The remaining proposals of the program have been merged. Well, there's still a scientific model whose author requested comparing our implementation with his, after it was merged, but I don't expect any surprises there.

Outside of the GSoC program, the nicest contribution has been updating the documentation dependencies versions: this gives a new fresh look-and-feel to the webpage (with some shortcuts and dark mode, yay!).

Before the program ends, I'd like to help a bit more on how to contribute. From the GitHub basics to each main section of how to develop new functions - the implementation, the tests and the documentation. Whether I do that here in this blog or on the official pages.

And that's all, I'm thankful to have worked with such a hardworking and committed group!
